    "# Lab 0: Generate Teacher Logits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to generate teacher model logits for knowledge distillation using AWS Neuron. Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller \"student\" model learns to mimic the behavior of a larger \"teacher\" model by training on the teacher's output probabilities (logits) rather than just the hard labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the [Qwen3-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B) model as your teacher model - a 30 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model that has been optimized for efficient inference. This teacher model will process a sentiment classification dataset and generate logits that capture the model's \"soft\" predictions across all possible output tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated logits will be saved to a JSON file and used in Lab 1 to train a smaller student model that can achieve similar performance with significantly fewer parameters and lower inference costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Teacher Model**: A large, high-performance model (Qwen3-30B-A3B) that generates training signals\n",
    "- **Logits**: Raw prediction scores before softmax, containing richer information than hard labels\n",
    "- **Neuron Compilation**: Converting PyTorch models to run efficiently on AWS Trainium/Inferentia accelerators\n",
    "- **Tensor Parallelism**: Distributing model layers across multiple NeuronCores for large model inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- AWS EC2 instance with Trainium/Inferentia (e.g., trn1.32xlarge or inf2.48xlarge)\n",
    "- AWS Neuron SDK installed (see setup.sh in the repository root)\n",
    "- Sufficient disk space for model compilation artifacts\n",
    "- Dataset file at `data/dataset.txt` with one text sample per line"
